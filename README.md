In the development *display: grid* and *display: flex* were used, which are supported by more than 96% of devices worldwide (according to the ["can i use" website](https://caniuse.com)).

The developed responsive layout was tested on a variety of devices (iOS, MacOS, Windows, Android) and browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) manually.

Also, the design was tested using a [website](https://responsivedesignchecker.com) where you can explore the site at different screen resolutions.

**All checks were successful and the layout worked well on any devices.**

**Some test examples:**
